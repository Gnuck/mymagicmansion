# mymagicmansion

Our group utilized the CUGL game engine to develop our game.  Our work is found primarily in directory "mymagicmansion/Technical Prototype/source/". Additionally, an apk file is included which will install the latest version of our game on any Android device.

Anastasia is lost in a magical mansion where the rooms move in mysterious ways. Help guide her to safety, but don’t let her fall into nothingness!

Magic Moving Mansion Mania is an action-puzzle-platformer that couples fast-paced gameplay with mentally stimulating puzzles. You play by tapping on two different tiles to switch their locations: it’s as simple as that! Anastasia will continue moving forward. Some more complex levels also include multiple layers in the mansion which you can navigate by swiping up or down or moving Anastasia through a door.
