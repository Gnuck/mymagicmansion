/**
 The AnimationController class helps you animating properties by maintaining a
 list of Animations. By providing a function pointer that takes exactly one
 argument (the value being animated) you can leave actual updating and timing to
 this class. Individual Animations can also be sped up, reversed, played with a
 custom time-scale, cancelled, completed instantly, and so on. You can also set
 a handler which will be called when the animation is complete.
 
 Animation works on all types T where T * float and T + T are defined.
