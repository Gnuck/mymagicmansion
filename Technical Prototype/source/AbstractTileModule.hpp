/**
 An abstract class defining what all pieces making up a tile should provide to
 the level loader. A module in a tile should know how its collision geometry and
 how it is drawn (scene graph node). All module classes act as factories, in
 that only ONE instance is enough to create the whole level. Just reconfigure
 and keep calling generateNew.
 
 Implementation notes:
 
 - make sure in the main get methods, you are CREATING new things and returning
 
 - you need to make sure the textures you mention are properly loaded, take a
   look at assets.json file under Assets/json. For now just chuck the image in
   there, we will come back to it later.
 
 - finally, to test whether the componnet you created works, go to Andy's
   LevelController, find where he creates the component you are doing, and
   replace his code. See if things work out.
